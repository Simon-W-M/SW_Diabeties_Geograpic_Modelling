# Geographic Modelling for Optical Diabeties Screening
## NHS England South West Intelligence and Insights

### About the Project

In development
[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

This repository holds code for the Geographic Modelling for Optical Diabeties Screening  project.  This is a project to explore a modelled diabeties population and applies travel times to sites to explore coverage in SW ICBs. Further optimisaion is checked against proposed sites to determine possible optimal sites. 

_**Note:** Only public or fake data are shared in this repository._

### Project Stucture

- The main code is found in the root of the repository (see Usage below for more information)
- The accompanying [report](./reports/report.pdf) is also available in the `reports` folder
- More information about the code usage can be found in the [model card](./model_card.md)
